# Copper
An Open source compiled programming language, In development.

NOTICE:
- Copper is in early development, pardon me if files and programming are messy. Some things may also not work.

# Goals
Copper is an general-purpose OOP language.

Coppers main goal is to allow easy editability of its syntax, so programmers are in total control of how their programming
language looks without having to make their own. You will not have to download the source code to make changes to the language.

Example:

Change the normal declaration of a variable in copper:

```var myvar = "hello, world!" ```

To a python-like syntax:

```myvar = "hello, world!"```

Other goals
- make the programming language easy.
- make the programming language fast
- make the programming language secure
- if possible, add cross platform gp gpu scripting

# Progress
I am still kind of getting into assembly, so the progress is slow
- [ ] simple variables
- [ ] Logging to the console
- [ ] string/variable concatination
- [ ] simple functions
- [ ] functions in functions
- [ ] OpenGL libs
- [ ] OpenAL libs
- [ ] Simple networking libs

(More will probably be added to the checklist later)

# Contributions.
Not accepting contributions yet :(

# Nasm
This programming language is not distributed with nasm yet, which it uses to compile to. You'll have to download it yourself currently.
