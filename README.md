**********************************
# Copper
An Open source compiled programming language, In development.

NOTICE:
- New versions will be coming out slowly due to the developer having a lot of other tasks to do outside of this project.

# Goals
Copper is an general-purpose OOP language.

Coppers main goal is to allow easy editability of its syntax, so programmers are in total control of how their programming
language looks without having to make their own.

Example:

Change the normal declaration of a variable in copper:

```var: myvar $= `hello, world!` ```

To a python-like syntax:

```myvar = "hello, world!"```

Other goals
- make the programming language easy.
- make the programming language fast
- make the programming language secure

# Progress
I am still kind of getting into assembly, so the progress is slow
- [X] simple variables
- [X] Logging to the console
- [ ] string/variable concatination
- [X] simple functions
- [ ] functions in functions
- [ ] OpenGL libs
- [ ] OpenAL libs
- [ ] Simple networking libs

(More will probably be added to the checklist later)

# Problems
 - Functions and variables will do weird stuff if their names are four characters.

# Contributions.
Not accepting contributions yet :(

# Code Organization
The code in Coppers compiler is not organized as I would like it to be yet. I will be changing it soon.

# Nasm
This programming language is not distributed with nasm yet, which it uses to compile to. You'll have to download it yourself currently.
